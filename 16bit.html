        <h2>16 Bit</h2>
        <p>
            Moving onto 16-bit graphics, popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this style has greater detail and better use of color than 8-bit graphics. Since the hardware can handle displaying more colors than the 8-bit hardware, 16-bit games used noticeably more color. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Pixels are still visible in 16-bit graphics but are less noticeable than in 8-bit. 
Characters and backgrounds were more complex and had more fluid motion than previous games. This gave players a more immersive experience and gave game designers greater creative freedom over graphics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            16-bit video game consoles include the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo SNES.
