        <h2>3D</h2>
        <p>
            Next are 3D-style graphics, which were popular in the 1990s and 2000s. There is a wide range of 3D graphics since they improved vastly from their introduction to their later years and eventual evolution into HD and realism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3D graphics had more detail, texture, and better quality than 16-bit graphics. There were also many differences in artistic styles, as shown in the games below. Some featured a more cartoon style, such as Super Mario 64, while others, such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, focused on creating a realistic setting and character design. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Video game consoles with 3D graphics include the Nintendo 64, the original Play Station, Play Station 2, and Microsoft Xbox.
